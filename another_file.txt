I am changing this file today and will commit this change. 

It was originally created on the will branch.

/* here is some text */
some more text
some more text

added some text into the middle which should confuse the merge
//some more text

this will cause a conflict if i also change the will branch and try to merge

There were merge conflicts so I'm looking through them online
This is a real pain in the specific case of the gui automatically generated files - which is just awful
I've found a workaround for that.
