This was another file - that I'm now editing

It was originally created on the will branch.

here is some text
some more text
some more text
added some text into the middle which should confuse the merge
some more text

There were merge conflicts so I'm looking through them online
This is a real pain in the specific case of the gui automatically generated files - which is just awful
I've found a workaround for that. 

TBH it makes more sense to do everything all on your local pc

I'll also show you how you can go back

blah blah blah appending some more stuff
